# Meme-Master
You can click on the text and edit them. There is a drag bar at bottom right corner, by which you can change the position of text. When you are happy with the meme, click the Generate button. You will see a pop up showing you the meme we generated. You can download or share it but remember that the meme is saved in your account only when you click the Save button. (You need to sign in).
As you might have noticed, there are two upload buttons above the meme. You should use the first one to upload a background picture and add text on it using our app. The second upload button allows you to upload flattened meme directly into your account. Later, you can see there are Edit buttons for the memes you make but none for the flattened ones.
From the top right corner, you can enter the MyMeme page, where you can see all saved memes in either Table view or List view. The toggle for view is also at the top right corner.
We also put some effort into making the pages responsive. Even though it is not perfectly responsive, you can still try to resize your browser and I believe the page wonâ€™t look so bad. Also, we used local storage to store the recent image you upload, so feel free to refresh page if you want to clear all the text.
